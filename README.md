)To use the rest platform back end right now download the code and type "go run main.go" into the terminal.
Then download a program like insomnia or your prefered program for rest apis. 
For insomia specifically I've included a project group for it.
[Insomnia_2023-11-09.json](https://github.com/AlexBowmanCoding/rest-platform-back-end/files/13311429/Insomnia_2023-11-09.json
For the user login api use json like this:
{
"id":"(anynumber)"
"username":"YourUserName"
"password":"YourPassword"
}
